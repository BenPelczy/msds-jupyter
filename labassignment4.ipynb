    "## Problem 1\n",
    "The Genius API documentation is here: https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1. Read through the documentation carefully. Although the Genius API is free and public, it still requires users an access key to use the API. In this case, Genius provides users with three codes: a client ID, a client ID secret, and a client access token. Use the documentation to find a way to obtain these codes for yourself. Write a paragraph that describes all of the steps you needed to take (but DO NOT list your access codes in this paragraph).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hints and cautions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before you can use the API, you will need a regular, free user account with Genius. Sign-up here: https://genius.com/signup_or_login\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Genius's API is built to support third-party app development, not data scientists. The language is entirely geared toward app development. Under \"Authentication\" there are instructions to third-party developers for guiding their own users in getting access keys. That's not relevant to getting access for yourself. It's not hard to get an access key, but the guidance here is not very clear. Be patient and read everything in the Authentication section carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you arrive at the page that allows you to register for API access keys, the language is still geared toward app development. You will be prompted to name your app and provide the URLs associated with the app. It doesn't much matter what you name your app, and I just used the Collab main page (https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal?containerLogin=true) for the URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When you get your codes, copy them in a text file. In problem 2 you will copy these codes over again to a `.env` file. [4 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "**First, we visited the Genius API Client management page to create an API client; this required us to sign up for a Genius user account. Then we created the API client \"MSDS Lab 3\", and copied the resulting client id, secret, and access token to our .env file.**"
